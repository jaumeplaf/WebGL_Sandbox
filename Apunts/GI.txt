    (?) repassar teoria integrals i derivades!!!
    ·Solving the Rendering Equation
        ·Differential solid angles
        ·Irradiance: how much light is hitting a surface from all possible directions
        ·BRDF: bidirectional reflectance distribution functions -> how much light is reflected
        ·Reflection equation:
            Integrate over hemisphere
            fr is the BRDF
        ·Light transport equation
            Indefinite derivatives, we must use numerical solutions:
                Finite elements methods (FEM)
                Monte Carlo methods: 
                Simplifications
        ·Algorythms that solve the RE:
            Path tracing: chose only a "path" on a ray tracing tree
            Bidirectional path tracing
            Photon maps: more efficient for caustics, 
            Radiosity
            Irradiance cache method
            ...

(!)check SSAO in Rewild -> maybe it's the thing causing problems in groundBlend
